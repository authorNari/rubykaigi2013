- title: Show Your Opensource Activities w/ ScreenX TV
  description: |-
    Knowing WHAT you code is easy; just check your GitHub account, but
    knowing HOW you code is still difficult. So, we made ScreenX TV, an opensource
    terminal broadcasting tool, which lets you easily broadcast your terminal to the
    world.

    In this lightning talk, I'll show you how to broadcast, how it works
    on Rails+Node.js, and how it's used by terminal broadcasters.

- title: Log Strategy at DeNA with Haikanko - a management tool of fluentd cluster
  description: "In this session, I present the log utilization strategy at DeNA, and
    introduce a tool named Haikanko.\n\nHaikanko is an application to manage fluentd
    cluster easily. It enables to generate fluentd configuration files automatically,
    and deploy them onto lots of fluentd nodes by one click.  \n\nHaikanko is written
    with ruby / sinatra / erb / mina (yet another capistrano)."

- title: a test code generator for RSpec users
  description: "rspec-kickstarter is a test code generator for RSpec users. \n\n[https://github.com/seratch/rspec-kickstarter](https://github.com/seratch/rspec-kickstarter)\n\nTDD
    is a very useful approach but actually many projects are not fully TDD-based and
    we sometimes need to face apps that don't have enough coverage. In such a situation,
    I believe that this tool is especially useful.\n\nIt's easy to say \"You should
    write tests for the legacy code before modifying it\" but it's not always easy
    to keep the motivation to do the right thing because developers have many things
    to do before they start writing essential parts of test. It's messy to create
    a new file or figure out the existing spec file, find out what the lacking test
    cases are and write routine stuff which starts with 'describe'.\n\nrspec-kickstarteer
    enables developers writing test immediately. If the spec is absent, it generates
    a new spec template file. Furthermore, it appends lacking test cases (with TODO
    comments) to existing the spec file if they're found. \n\nI know that testing
    for methods is not perfect but it's pretty important to reduce the psychological
    barrier. \n\nI'll show some examples about rspec-kickstarter in this talk."

- title: Introduction of ‘3dcg-arts.net’
  description: "I would like to talk about the use of rspec and CI (Jenkins) to improve
    reliability of 3D computer graphics models conversion software. \nI'll introduce
    '3dcg-arts.net', which provides sharing (publish, browse, evaluate, etc) 3D computer
    graphics works on web browsers. \nIn this service, we developed a software to
    convert 3D models to a common format for convenient view on web browsers and use
    rspec and CI for reliability check."

- title: Challenges building a call center with 3rd party APIs
  description: |-
    Even with the help of third party APIs (Twilio, Tropo, Adhersion, etc.) that provide telephony functionality, there are mayor design decisions involved when building a call center.

    But thanks to the ruby community and the availability of incredible gems and libraries this task is now simple enough that just a few developers can build and replicate full feature telephony systems.
